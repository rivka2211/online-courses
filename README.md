# OnlineCourses-Rivki Elfenbein

I'm really sorry, but I didn't have enough time to finish, so there's no reference to the lessons within the courses (yes, I created a service and component for them, I just didn't have time to use them)

## The Routing Problem

I'm not sure why, after all the changes, it still doesn't automatically go to the course assessment after registration - we just have to redirect ourselves to the home page URL.

## The Authentication

There is no separate screen according to access permissions, but within the courses screen, the teacher and administrator have editing options, unlike a student who can only view, join/leave a course.

## Other Problem

Unfortunately, the Add Course/Update Course Details form does not load. You can see its beautiful code in add-course-modal.component.

# GOOD BY!!!!!
